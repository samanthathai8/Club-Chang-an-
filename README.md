## Why Baseball?
Hi, I'm Samantha Thai, and as you can tell from the making of this website, I am a very passionate baseball watcher. Well, mainly just the Dodgers, but overall, I love the game. I grew up watching my brother's baseball games, and to this day, I am his biggest fan on the bleachers. A family hobby of my mine is to visit baseball fields and go to baseball games! We've been to stadium in Arizona and San Diego, and of course, Los Angeles and Anaheim, and we hope to visit more some day.
