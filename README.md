### Why Baseball?
Hi, I'm Samantha Thai, and as you can tell from the making of this website, I am a very passionate baseball watcher. Well, mainly just the Dodgers, but overall, I love the game. I grew up watching my brother's baseball games, and to this day, I am his biggest fan on the bleachers. A family hobby of my mine is to visit baseball fields and go to baseball games! We've been to stadium in Arizona and San Diego, and of course, Los Angeles and Anaheim, and we hope to visit more some day. 

### My Favorite Ballpark
Even though I am a Dodger fan, I can confidently say the best ballpark, and my favorite one is Petco Park in San Diego. I've visited Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres) a couple of times, and I really like the the layout of the stadium, and the fact that they have family friendly activities within the ballpark as well. At Petco Park, there is a small baseball field (WAY smaller than the actual major league field) behind center field, where kids can hit plastic balls witg plastic bats, simulating a baseball game. Adjacent to that activity is an actual park, with hills of grass and trees. When I went to Petco Park with my family friends when we went on a trip to San Diego, we spent most of our time hanging around that area. But, my favorite feature at Petco Park is the food. The food is SUPERB, in comparison to the other stadiums I've been to. They have such a wide range of options, and not just hotdogs and nachos. They even have a marketplace and a Din Tai Fung (an amazing Chinese restaurant. 

### Honarable Mention- Chase Field!
Chase Field, the stadium of the Arizona Diamondbacks, was a ballpark I really enjoyed visiting. This is mainly because of their dome, and how they close off the stadium to have a roof, due to the warm Arizona heat. My brother also got handed a baseball from David Peralta! My family and I had a very fun time sitting in front of the outfiled seats, right behind the left-fielder!

###### Here are two photos from our trip to Chase Field. As you can see, I am holding a baseball that David Peralta gave to us, but also the dome, something that very few major league baseball fields have.

### The Best Baseball Stadium
Though I am very biased towards the Dodgers, and would recommend everyone, even non-baseball fans, to visit at least once, I would definitely say Petco Park is the best for an experience. The food is "out of the park" and even non-baseball fans can enjoy all the amendities that the stadium offers, like its picnic-like park, baseball activities for younger children, and the live music. And, who can forget about the downtown San Diego view right next to it? I definitely would visit Petco Park again!
